🔴 Problem Statement (Clear & Professional)

In today’s rapidly evolving job market, students and early-stage professionals often struggle to identify the right career path due to a lack of personalized guidance. While abundant information about careers and skills is available online, it is highly scattered, generic, and overwhelming. Most learners are unable to clearly map their interests, existing skills, and career goals to suitable learning paths and future opportunities.

Additionally, traditional career counseling systems are either expensive, time-consuming, or inaccessible to many students. This gap results in poor career decisions, skill mismatch, low confidence, and delayed professional growth. Therefore, there is a strong need for an intelligent, accessible, and personalized career guidance system that can assist users in making informed career and skill-development decisions.
